This case study explains the concept of d-seperation. Two variables are said to be d-separated if all paths between them are blocked (otherwise they are d-connected). Two sets of variables are said to be d-separated if each variable in the first set is d-separated from every variable in the second set. The case study provides an overview of the rules, that determine whether a path is blocked or not including simple examples illustrating those rules. All rules and examples are visualised in DAGs (Directed acyclic graphs). Finally, a more complex DAG is discussed to show how all backdoor paths between two variables can be closed, so that they are d-seperated.
